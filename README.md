This is a collection of scripts for [kOS]("https://www.github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS")
to perform various missions.

While much of the code is not commented well, I do hope that by sharing I will
be able to help others write their own scripts.  You may use them as you wish,
but I would recommend using them as a reference instead of running them without
modification.  The process of translating the logic from a reference to your own
implementation is likely to dramatically improve your learning experience.

To be clear, I write scripts for my own missions and for testing kOS itself.  I
am not likely to provide a script upon user request.  If you see something that
needs to be changed I may accept pull requests, but there are no guarantees.

This repository is a continuous work in progress.  I will try to update it
as regularly as possible.  Any code I commit to the master branch should "work".
If I am working on a new script that is not yet working, I'll wait to upload it.
The scripts may however have a number of commented lines, some of which may
very well lack a note explaining why.  I don't consider this a final product
repository, and I won't hold the same standard that I expect when working on kOS
itself.

The implementation may very well be inconsistent.  Since I started using kOS in
2014 there have been a number of changes in kOS itself and in my programming
style.  In general I try to use the same style as the C# code backing kOS, but
that was not always the case.

If you're looking for help, I highly recomment checking out the kOS sub-reddit
or the kOS release forum thread:
